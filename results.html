      You're life companion should be a +bluewhale+, because you're a very nice person.<br>
      Your favorite dish is probably pizza. Like the +bluewhale+ you like to eat a lot.<br>
      When you where a kid you probably fell on your bike. The +bluewhale+ didn't do that, because it is not stupid.<br>
      You're depressed and that's why a +bluewhale+ fits you perfectly!
